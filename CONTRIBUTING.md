## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution. It would be great if a PR address a proper filled issue too!


### Is it of good quality

- There are no spelling mistakes and it reads well
- It builds (eg, CI workflow/job is green)
- It solves one problem and solves it well

You can refer to the `README` document, as long other sources of documentation to learn how to get started with local developement on this project.

Thank you so much for your PRs üî•
