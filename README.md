# Bitrise Reports

> _Complete blog post to come. Stay tuned!_

## Context

Main features:

- Backed by [Bitrise REST API](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/) under the hood
- Computes minutes for queued, building and total execution, for all builds in given a time frame
- Breakdown numbers per machine type (aka Bitrise Build Stack) and also per Workflow
- Supports emulation of consumed [Bitrise Velocity credits](https://www.bitrise.io/velocity-plan) (for Enterprise customers)
- Report types : CLI (stdout), JSON and Excel spreadsheet

## Installing

This tool requires Python, supporting versions 3.8.x and 3.9.x.

Install `bitrise-reports` with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

```bash
â†’ pip install bitrise-reports
```

## Using

Let's say you want see analyse numbers for the project `my-app`, learning from
the builds that ran during February of 2021. You'll firstly need a
[Bitrise Personal Access Token](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/api/authentication/) for
that. Note you must be a member in the project you want to analyse.

By running

```bash
â†’ bitrise-reports \
    --token=$BITRISE_PAT_TOKEN \
    --app=my-app \
    --starting=2021-02-01 \
    --ending=2021-02-28
```

you should get something like that on your CLI

The full list CLI options :

| Option   | Details                                    | Required  |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|
| token    | Personal access token for Bitrise API      | Yes       |
| app      | The title of your app in Bitrise           | Yes       |
| starting | Starting date in the target time frame     | Yes       |
| ending   | Ending date in the target time frame       | Yes       |
| report   | The style of report you want               | No        |
| velocity | Estimate Bitrise Velocity credits consumed | No        |

where

- `starting` and `ending` follows **YYYY-MM-DD** convention
- `report` accepts **stdout** (default), **json** and **excel**
- `velocity`is a CLI flag

For instance, if you want an Excel spreadsheet instead of the fancy CLI UI from the previous example
while also estimating Velocity usage for the builds, you can run

```bash
â†’ bitrise-reports \
    --token=$BITRISE_PAT_TOKEN \
    --app=my-app \
    --starting=2021-02-01 \
    --ending=2021-02-28 \
    --report=excel \
    --velocity
```

and the output file `bitrise-reports.xlsx` will be available in the same folder.
