## What

A simple cruncher for numbers derived from builds you run on [Bitrise CI](https://www.bitrise.io/). Useful if you are in charge of managing infrastructure capacity related to Bitrise, like detecting/reporting anomalies, evaluating queues impact and so on.

Main features:

- Backed by [Bitrise REST API](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/) under the hood
- Computes queued, running and total execution times for all builds found in the target time frame
- Breakdown numbers per machine type and also per Workflow
- Supports emulation of consumed [Bitrise Velocity credits](https://www.bitrise.io/velocity-plan) (for Enterprise customers)
- Report types : CLI (stdout), JSON and Excel spreadsheet

## Installing

This tool requires Python, supporting versions 3.8.x and 3.9.x.

Install `bitrise-reports` with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

```bash
â†’ pip install bitrise-reports
```

## Using

Let's say you want analyse numbers for the project `my-app`, learning from
builds that ran during February of 2021. You'll firstly need a
[Bitrise Personal Access Token](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/api/authentication/) for
that. Note you must be a member in the project you want to analyse.

By running

```bash
â†’ bitrise-reports \
    --token=$BITRISE_PAT_TOKEN \
    --app=my-app \
    --starting=2021-02-01 \
    --ending=2021-02-28
```
you should get something like that on your CLI

The complete list of CLI options:

| Option   | Details                                           | Required  |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| token    | Personal access token for Bitrise API             | Yes       |
| app      | The title of your app in Bitrise                  | Yes       |
| starting | Starting date in the target time frame            | Yes       |
| ending   | Ending date in the target time frame              | Yes       |
| report   | The style of report you want                      | No        |
| statuses | Estimate successes and failures related to builds | No        |
| velocity | Estimate Bitrise Velocity credits consumed        | No        |


where

- `starting` and `ending` follow **YYYY-MM-DD** convention
- `report` accepts **stdout** (default), **json** or **excel**
- `velocity` is a CLI flag
- `statuses` is a CLI flag

For instance, if you want an Excel spreadsheet - instead of the fancy Terminal UI from the previous example -
and also an estimation of Velocity usage, you can run

```bash
â†’ bitrise-reports \
    --token=$BITRISE_PAT_TOKEN \
    --app=my-app \
    --starting=2021-02-01 \
    --ending=2021-02-28 \
    --report=excel \
    --velocity
```

and the output file `bitrise-metrics.xlsx` will be available in the same folder.
